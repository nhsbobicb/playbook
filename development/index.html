    <p>This playbook is in development, however, in line with working in the open, is publicly accessible throughout that time. Content within the guide has not been fully tested, nor adopted, and is a <b>work in progress</b> and should be treated as such.</p>
  </div>
<p><b>The way we learn and develop:</b> As a team, learning and developing together and as individuals is very important. We dedicate the right amount of time and effort and support one another to achieve personal and team goals. We develop skills to let us progress in our roles now, as well as continue our future career paths.</p>
<p>All of our learning and development offer is tied to the national <a href="https://job-profiles.fedip.org/">Federation for Informatics Professionals (FEDIP)</a> job families. This divides skills into <a href="https://www.fedip.org/_files/ugd/c2f91b_6d16cbd1572c4d108593458ec519a639.pdf">five levels</a>, each associted with an AfC banding.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Associate Practitioner (Band 2/3/4)</li>
  <li>Practitioner (Band 5/6)</li>
  <li>Senior Practitioner (Band 7/8a)</li>
  <li>Advanced Pracitioner (Band 8b/8c)</li>
  <li>Leading Practitioner (Band 8d/9)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our roles may cross job families or role descriptions within the FEDIP framework. The important thing is that we all know what skills we are developing and how we will work in our teams (with line managers and project managers) to do that.</p>

<h2>Our welcome process</h2>
<p>Before joining, all staff will be sent an induction pack and a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Health-Design-Thinking-Creating-Products/dp/0262539136">one of our favourite books</a>, which covers many of the concepts we believe in.</p>
<p>When joining the team, each new team member can expect a welcome to the ICB, and a welcome to the ICS transformation team. This includes sessions on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Welcome to the ICB (expenses, benefits, HR processes, etc.)</li>
  <li>Who's who in the system? (our partners, key contacts)</li>
  <li>How do I get things done? (governance, finance, procurement)</li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/development/course-transform">Patient-centred digital transformation [with system partners]</a> - our introductory course on user-centred design skills</li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/development/course-data">Data into action [with system partners]</a> - our introductory course on using BOB's tools to do data-driven transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>We make sure all new joiners have a buddy, who is a team member of a similar level, who can help them with questions and help them settle in.</p>

<h2>Our development offer</h2>
<p>We develop personally, and together as a team. As a rule we believe in spending 80% of time learning on projects, 15% learning from the wider team and 5% on formal learning (though we encourage apprenticeships and postgraduate education).</p>
<h3>Directorate</h3>
<p>We join the whole directorate fortnightly for a town hall and quarterly for an in-person development away day.</p>
<h3>Team</h3>
<p>We work in two teams, our project teams and together as a whole DDaT transformation team.</p>
<p>We come together bi-monthly as a whole team for a protected L&D day. This is where we showcase the work the team has been doing and allow time for smaller sessions and 1:1 catch-ups.</p>
<p>In our project teams we recommend a fortnightly retrospective and wellbeing check-in (taking whichever form the team prefers!). This should also cover reflections and learning on the project.</p>
<h3>Personal - Informal</h3>
<p>In the Oxford office, we provide a library of books we have enjoyed as a team. If there's a title we haven't got access to, we encourage team members to put in a request and we will order a copy. This includes:</p>

      Our Library
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <ul>
      <li>Content Design - Sarah Richards</li>
      <li>Health Design Thinking - Bon Ku and Ellen Lupton</li>
      <li>How to Implement Evidence-based Healthcare - Trisha Greenhalgh</li>
      <li>Invisible Women - Caroline Criado Perez</li>
      <li>Immunity to Change - Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey</li>
      <li>The Creative Destruction of Medicine - Eric Topol</li>
      <li>The Digital Doctor - Bob Watcher</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>
<p>As part of our bi-monthly in-person team development day, we set aside time for our team members to talk each other 1:1.</p>
<p>We actively seek out opportunities for our team members to shadow teams inside ICS organisations as well as elsewhere in the ICB because we know it's important to understand how other teams work and what they do. This leads to better digital transformation!</p>
<p>We support our team members to mentor and be mentored, whether this is within our team, or more widely.</p>

<h3>Personal - Formal</h3>
<p>The ICB provides access to <a href="https://www.nhselect.nhs.uk/">NHS Elect</a> which provides a range of free training in cross-cutting skills. We supplement this with access to the <a href="https://www.dls.nhs.uk/v2/Home/Welcome">NHS Digital Learning Solutions</a> platform, which provides training in basic and intermediate office skills.</p>
<p>We take the following principles when it comes to the various formal courses that are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The list below contains <i>some</i> of the vast array of training that is available - we encourage team members to find what's right for them and we can add it to the list later.</li>
  <li>Just because a course is aimed at one job family, it doesn't mean it isn't useful or allowed for others - e.g. if you're a project manager who wants to learn more about data analysis we encourage this!</li>
  <li>Where courses require funding (or significant time commitment like apprenticeships) we consider these on a case-by-case basis, prioritising those who don't already have a qualification of that level, or in that area.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cross-cutting (behaviours, leadership, cross-cutting knowledge)</h4>
<p>In line with domain-specific skills, we provide and encourage our team to take up opportunities to become (and improve as) leaders in digital health and care.</p>
