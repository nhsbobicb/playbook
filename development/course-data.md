## Detail
The team will run through the basics of the population health data we have available and then support participants to use the tools to solve more complex queries, as well as some of their own. This focuses on the System Insights tool and aims to leave participants with the skills they need to make the best use out of self-service tools as well as analysts.

## Cohorts
This course is in development as part of our ICS DDaT Workforce plan, and dates will be released shortly.
