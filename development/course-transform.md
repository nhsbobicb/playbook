## Detail
You have recently been appointed as a “Service Designer” by NHS Newtown and Northshire ICB. The CEO has called you in because she’s concerned about an article she’s recently seen in the local press.


<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/newspaper.PNG">

She has asked you to put together a multi-disciplinary team to investigate, propose a solution to the issue and to implement it.

The course covers the basic user-centred design skills, applied through the case study of:

* User Research - user interviews, observation and ethnographic studies
* Service Design - front of house and back of house design
* Business Analysis - using data to identify priority areas to intervene and to evaluate success
* Product Management - writing user needs and prioritisation
* Agile Delivery Management - Scrum and Kanban in practice

Those who finish the course gain access to a private networking space and set of events run exclusively for graduates of the course. We encourage participants from each cohort to set up 2 action learning sets, which will encourage participants to apply the skills more widely in their day-to-day work.

## Cohorts
This course is in development as part of our ICS DDaT Workforce plan, and dates will be released shortly.

_* Free for staff employed in NHS or Local Authorities in Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West or organisations commissioned by Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West ICB._
