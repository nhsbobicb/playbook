When asked to write a blog, I sat and reflected for a time and thought rather than approach this purely from a digital angle, I would look to share my experiences as a patient, a former nurse and a digital professional in the NHS.

Three years ago, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension) by my GP. I think I should point out that this diagnosis was made secondary to the reason I was attending my GP Surgery on the day. In fact, this was the first time I had sat in front of my GP in over eight years! You can probably deduce that I am not the easiest patient to manage despite being a former Nurse and a former Charge Nurse in ED. While I made some changes to my lifestyle, it wasn’t until early 2024 when I understood I was no longer indestructible. By this time, I was in the very early stages of type 2 diabetes and had some changes to my liver.

Without the care and advice of health professionals, along with some willpower and desire to change my lifestyle, I would not be sat here typing while feeling really well. I have well controlled blood pressure and am no longer diabetic. The fitness and lifestyle journey continues, and I am fortunate to be in a position to create a future for others through the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention (CVD)work I lead from a digital viewpoint.

Why is CVD Prevention so important? Well, I have seen firsthand the devastation caused when people have a heart attack or a stroke. These people can be young, have families and would have often had no symptoms prior to the event that changed their lives. Thankfully modern medicine and rehabilitation often means a good outcome is achievable. However, that is not always the case, and I have had to deliver some of the saddest news to families, then try and comfort them on a day they will never forget. If that isn’t a driver for improvement and change what is?

Imagine if we could use a digital Population health platform to support clinicians. Then use it to find out how many people have high blood pressure, ensure they are effectively monitored and target those who are currently in a low need cohort to ensure fewer numbers of these people go on to develop more serious issues leading to heart attacks and strokes. Well, we can do that now!

Working in combination with Dr Heike Veldtman, Primary Care leads and the fantastic digital professionals who support the Connected Care Systems Insights platform we can support GP Practices across the BOB ICB Footprint to manage the population they serve more effectively. It will require some learning and development to get to where we need to be. However, I am confident that in the coming months, a change in the management of people with hypertension will be adopted in more Practices, supported by the project team with links to the dedicated areas for hypertension within the system. When the Integrated Neighbourhood Teams are in place, the knowledge will be available to help these new teams understand the population they serve and help them provide more effective management of CVD.
