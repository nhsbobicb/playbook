Six months ago, a new team structure was introduced, and I was placed in the Primary Care Digital Transformation team. This shift marked a turning point in my role, expanding my focus specifically within Primary Care, while continuing to champion digital innovation across the sector.

One of the most notable experiences during this time has been working on an agile project using the Scrum framework. This was my first exposure to agile methodologies, and it came through our work on the Segmentation and Population Health Management project. Collaborating with colleagues across Frimley ICB, we adopted a fast-paced approach to deliver meaningful outputs on a weekly and even daily basis.

This experience not only introduced me to new ways of working but also highlighted the potential impact of segmentation for GP Practices. If widely adopted, this approach could lead to better demand management and improve health outcomes across patient populations, something that aligns closely with the broader goals of transformation in Primary Care.

I'm also currently leading my first procurement project, which involves sourcing a Clinical Decision Support Tool. This tool aims to support GP Practices with clinical templates and referral management. Navigating the procurement process has introduced me to a whole new set of milestones and governance requirements, offering a valuable learning curve.

Additionally, I’ve taken on budget and spend management for SMS fragments across BOB GP Practices. This has involved compiling a monthly dashboard for GP Practices to monitor their usage and have an oversight to better their communication methods and cost savings.

These past six months have been both challenging and rewarding. They’ve broadened my skills and deepened my understanding of how digital transformation can drive real improvements in Primary Care. I’m excited for what’s next!
