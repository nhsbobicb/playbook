<p>The aim of this section is to set out how we do things in our team and share it with the world and anyone else who needs to know</p>
<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
  <p>We deliver digital enablers to effective, timely service transformation and benefits with patients and staff at the centre.</p>
  <p><i>Transformation Team Vision</i></p>
</div>

<h2>How we do things around here...</h2>
<p>As a team we:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Put Patients and Staff at the Centre</b> - we adhere to the NHS Service Standard and employ best practice user-centred design principles</li>
    <li><b>Work on Services not Software</b> - we work backwards from what people need / want to the technical solution, rather than forcing solutions onto people</li>
    <li><b>Form Multi-disciplinary Teams</b> - we work closely with non-digital teams and work jointly to solve problems, rather than digital / data being a silo working separately</li>
    <li><b>Keep Track</b> - we use GDS-style Agile or PRINCE2 methodologies (using the best methodology for the task), keeping in tolerance and reporting on time, cost, quality, scope, benefits and risk</li>
    <li><b>Are Curious and Bold</b> - we're not afraid to try things, make mistakes and learn from them</li>
    <li><b>Work in the Open</b> - we communicate regularly and openly with the public, staff and the wider DDaT directorate around what we are doing</li>
    <li><b>Learn and Develop</b> - we make sure each project / programme provides developmental opportunities for the team and we carve out time regularly to develop together</li>
  </ul>
