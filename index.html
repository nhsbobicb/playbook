                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <p>We are a team of 11 people working within the BOB ICB Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team in the Strategy, Digital and Transformation directorate. We are split into the <b>Primary and Community Transformation</b> team and the <b>ICS Transformation</b> team.</p>
                <h2>Why we exist</h2>
                <p>We deliver digital enablers to effective, timely service transformation and benefits with patients and staff at the centre.</p>
                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <h3>Primary and Community Transformation</h3>
                <p>We deliver the digital and data enablers (both tools and transformation support) to ensure success of the <a href="https://www.bucksoxonberksw.icb.nhs.uk/our-strategies-and-plans/primary-care-strategy/">BOB Primary Care Strategy</a>.</p>
                <p>This involves a programme of work in the areas of Access, CVD Prevention and Neighbourhood Health. </p>
                <p>We also look after a number of additional ICB-funded digital tools/services for primary care organisations which don't form part of the GP IT offer.</p>
                <h3>ICS Transformation</h3>
                <p>We play a part in delivering the <a href="https://www.bucksoxonberksw.icb.nhs.uk/how-we-work/digital-data/">ICS Digital and Data Strategy</a> alongside our ICS partners. This focuses on digitising our organisations, connecting our care settings better digitally and transforming the way we work using digital and data.</p>
                <p>The work we deliver is driven by patient, staff and organisational needs. At the moment our portfolio of projects includes:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Increasing the amount and quality of information shared digitally between professionals by introducing new data into the TVS Care Record</li>
                    <li>Changing the way that the ReSPECT advanced care planning process works across BOB to improve information sharing</li>
                    <li>Piloting sensor-based falls detection technology in care homes <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--aqua-green">Funded by DHSC/NHS England</strong></li>
                    <li>Investigating how we could improve the digital experience for patients interacting with patient portals in our NHS Trusts</li>
                    <li>Understanding how AI (such as MS Copilot) could benefit staff working within the ICB and ICS</li>
                    <li>Taking ownership for improving digital access to health with a range of digital inclusion initiatives (such as Digital Cafes and Laptop Reuse)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>We also look after <a href="https://www.bucksoxonberksw.icb.nhs.uk/how-we-work/digital-data/tvs-care-record/">TVS Care Records</a> in BOB which provides our Shared Care Record and Population Health Management platform.</p>
